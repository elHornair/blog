Properly formatting text can be hard. But it doesn't have to be.

Here is a little explainer of markdown and it's most important features:

1. List item
2. Also list item
3. And so on

## Images
But we can also have images:

![markdown editor showing raw markdown text and rendered markdown text side to side](/20210928_introduction-to-markdown/screenshot_markdown_editing.png "Markdown editor example")

In the image you can see the split screen from my markdown editor.

## Better way
There is a better way though:

<content-image
  src="/20210928_introduction-to-markdown/screenshot_markdown_editing.png"
  alt="markdown editor showing raw markdown text and rendered markdown text side to side"
  title="Markdown editor example">
</content-image>
