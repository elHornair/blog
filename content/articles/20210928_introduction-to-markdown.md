4. la
5. si
6. mango
7. lassi

## Images
But we can also have images:

![markdown editor showing raw markdown text and rendered markdown text side to side](/20210928_introduction-to-markdown/screenshot_markdown_editing.png "Markdown editor example")

In the image you can see the split screen from my markdown editor.

## Better way
There is a better way though:

<content-image
  src="/20210928_introduction-to-markdown/screenshot_markdown_editing.png"
  alt="markdown editor showing raw markdown text and rendered markdown text side to side"
  title="Markdown editor example">
</content-image>
